INTRODUCTION

Welcome to gUnit! I've been working on gUnit from 2007 summer and 
this is a project in USF CS, sponsored by professor Terence.

You should use the latest ANTLR v3.1 with gUnit:

What is gUnit?

gUnit is an unit testing framework for ANTLR grammars. It provides a 
simple way to write and run automated tests for grammars in a manner 
similar to what jUnit does for unit testing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do I install gUnit?

Just add gunit-1.0.5.jar to your CLASSPATH, and also make sure that
both ANTLR and StringTemplate jars lie in CLASSPATH.
