 *  want to continue lexing then you do not want to continue parsing.  Just
 *  throw an exception not under RecognitionException and Java will naturally
 *  toss you all the way out of the recognizers.  If you want to continue
 *  lexing then you should not throw an exception to the parser--it has already
 *  requested a token.  Keep lexing until you get a valid one.  Just report
 *  errors and keep going, looking for a valid token.
