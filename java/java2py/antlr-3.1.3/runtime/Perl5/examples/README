This directory contains examples for the Perl 5 code generation target.

First you need to compile ANTLR, running "ant" in the top level directory.

Then you need to build the Perl module.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make

After that you need to compile the grammar using ANTLR, for example by using
the antlr.bat I've added.

    cd examples\expr
    ..\..\antlr Expr.g

Finally you can run the example programs.
