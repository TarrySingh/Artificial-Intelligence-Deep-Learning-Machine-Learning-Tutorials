ANTLR::Runtime

This is the Perl 5 runtime for ANTLR.  It is currently under early
development.  Most parts are not working yet, and some of those that are need
to catch up with the current development version.  The good news is that some
parts are working, as illustrated by the examples.  You'd probably want to
take a look at examples/expr/.


KNOWN ISSUES
============

* Perl's syntax clashes with ANTLR's StringTemplate ('%') and variable ('$')
syntax.  Expect error messages like the following.

error(146): Expr.g:10:10: invalid StringTemplate % shorthand syntax: '%memory'
error(114): Expr.g:18:9: attribute is not a token, parameter, or return value: memory
error(114): Expr.g:36:9: attribute is not a token, parameter, or return value: v

Currently, it's best to check the syntax of the generated code, like so:

$ perl -c ExprLexer.pm
ExprLexer.pm syntax OK

$ perl -c ExprParser.pm
ExprParser.pm syntax OK

Or use the lexer/parser in an example.
