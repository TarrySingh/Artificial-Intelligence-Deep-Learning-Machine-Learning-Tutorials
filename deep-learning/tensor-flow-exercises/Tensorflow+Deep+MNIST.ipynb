    "Deep MNIST for Experts\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a powerful library for doing large-scale numerical computation. One of the tasks at which it excels is implementing and training deep neural networks. In this tutorial we will learn the basic building blocks of a TensorFlow model while constructing a deep convolutional MNIST classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction assumes familiarity with neural networks and the MNIST dataset. If you don't have a background with them, check out the introduction for beginners. Be sure to install TensorFlow before starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "About this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this tutorial explains what is happening in the [mnist_softmax.py](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_softmax.py) code, which is a basic implementation of a Tensorflow model. The second part shows some ways to improve the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy and paste each code snippet from this tutorial into a Python environment to follow along, or you can download the fully implemented deep net from [mnist_deep.py](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_deep.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will accomplish in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a softmax regression function that is a model for recognizing MNIST digits, based on looking at every pixel in the image\n",
    "- Use Tensorflow to train the model to recognize digits by having it \"look\" at thousands of examples (and run our first Tensorflow session to do so)\n",
    "- Check the model's accuracy with our test data\n",
    "- Build, train, and test a multilayer convolutional neural network to improve the results"
