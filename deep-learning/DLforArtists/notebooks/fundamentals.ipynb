    "## Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these guides is to go a bit deeper into the details behind common machine learning methods, assuming little math background, and teach you how to use popular machine learning Python packages. In particular, we'll focus on the Numpy, TensorFlow, and Keras libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll assume you have some experience programming with Python -- if not, check out these guides first: [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). It will really help to illustrate the concepts introduced here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy underlies most Python machine learning packages and is great for performing quick sketches or working through calculations. TensorFlow is rapidly gaining popularity and seems poised to become machine learning's standard library, given its GPU support, performance, development support (Google), and distributed computation abilities. It can be quite low-level, which is great for experimenting with novel algorithms, but can be tedious when you want to use existing battle-tested methods. Keras provides some higher-level interfaces on top of TensorFlow and makes it easy to move quickly with established methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These guides will present the formal math for concepts alongside Python code examples since this often (for me at least) is a lot easier to develop an intuition for. Each guide is also available as an iPython notebook for your own experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The guides are not meant to exhaustively cover the field of machine learning but I hope they will instill you with the confidence and knowledge to explore further on your own.\n",

    "### Modeling the world\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably seen various machine learning algorithms pop up -- linear regression, SVMs, neural networks, random forests, etc. How are they all related? What do they have in common? What is machine learning for anyways?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider the general, fundamental problem all machine learning is concerned with, leaving aside the algorithm name soup for now. The primary concern of machine learning is _modeling the world_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model phenomena or systems -- both natural and artificial, if you want to make that distinction -- with mathematical functions. We see something out in the world and want to describe it in some way, we want to formalize how two or more things are related, and we can do that with a function. The problem is, for a given phenomenon, how do we figure out what function to use? There are infinitely many to choose from!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before this gets too abstract, let's use an example to make things more concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a bunch of data about the heights and weights of a species of deer. We want to understand how these two variables are related -- in particular, given the weight of a deer, can we predict its height?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might see where this is going. The data looks like a line, and lines in general are described by functions of the form $y = mx + b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that lines vary depending on what the values of $m$ and $b$ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Varying lines](../assets/lines.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus $m$ and $b$ uniquely define a function -- thus they are called the _parameters_ of the function -- and when it comes to machine learning, these parameters are what we ultimately want to learn. So when I say there are infinitely many functions to choose from, it is because $m$ and $b$ can pretty much take on any value. Machine learning techniques essentially search through these possible functions to find parameters that best fit the data you have. One way machine learning algorithms are differentiated is by how exactly they conduct this search (i.e. how they learn parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we've (reasonably) assumed the function takes the form $y = mx + b$, but conceivably you may have data that doesn't take the form of a line. Real world data is typically a lot more convoluted-looking. Maybe the true function has a $sin$ in it, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where another main distinction between machine learning algorithms comes in -- certain algorithms can model only certain forms of functions. _Linear regression_, for example, can only model linear functions, as indicated by its name. Neural networks, on the other hand, are _universal function approximators_, which mean they can (in theory) approximate _any_ function, no matter how exotic. This doesn't necessarily make them a better method, just better suited for certain circumstances (there are many other considerations when choosing an algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's return to the line function. Now that we've looked at the $m$ and $b$ variables, let's consider the input variable $x$. A function takes a numerical input; that is $x$ must be a number of some kind. That's pretty straightforward here since the deer weights are already numbers. But this is not always the case! What if we want to predict the sales price of a house. A house is not a number. We have to find a way to _represent_ it as a number (or as several numbers, i.e. a vector, which will be detailed in a moment), e.g. by its square footage. This challenge of representation is a major part of machine learning; the practice of building representations is known as _feature engineering_ since each variable (e.g. square footage or zip code) used for the representation is called a _feature_.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, representation is a practice we regularly engage in. The word \"house\" is not a house any more than an image of a house is -- there is no true \"house\" anyways, it is always a constellation of various physical and nonphysical components.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's about it -- broadly speaking, machine learning is basically a bunch of algorithms that learn you a function, which is to say they learn the parameters that uniquely define a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In the line example before I mentioned that we might have multiple numbers representing an input. For example, a house probably can't be solely represented by its square footage -- perhaps we also want to consider how many bedrooms it has, or how high the ceilings are, or its distance from local transportation. How do we group these numbers together?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what _vectors_ are for (they come up for many other reasons too, but we'll focus on representation for now). Vectors, along with matrices and other tensors (which will be explained a bit further down), could be considered the \"primitives\" of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Numpy library is best for dealing with vectors (and other tensors) in Python, so before we go anywhere further, let's import `numpy`:"

    "Vectors are usually represented with lowercase variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we never specified how _many_ numbers (also called _components_) a vector has - because it can have any amount. The amount of components a vector has is called its _dimensionality_. The example vector above has two dimensions. The vector `x = [8,1,3]` has three dimensions, and so on. Components are usually indicated by their index (usually using 1-indexing), e.g. in the previous vector, $x_1$ refers to the value $8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Dimensions\" in the context of vectors is just like the spatial dimensions you spend every day in. These dimensions define a __space__, so a two-dimensional vector, e.g. `[5,4]`, can describe a point in 2D space and a three-dimensional vector, e.g. `[8,1,3]`, can describe a point in 3D space. As mentioned before, there is no limit to the amount of dimensions a vector may have (technically, there must be one or more dimensions), so we could conceivably have space consisting of thousands or tens of thousands of dimensions. At that point we can't rely on the same human intuitions about space as we could when working with just two or three dimensions. In practice, most interesting applications of machine learning deal with many, many dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get a better sense of this by plotting a vector out. For instance, a 2D vector `[5,0]` would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A vector](../assets/vector.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a sense vectors can be thought of lines that \"point\" to the position they specify - here the vector is a line \"pointing\" to `[5,0]`. If the vector were 3D, e.g. `[8,1,3]`, then we would have to visualize it in 3D space, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So vectors are great - they allow us to form logical groupings of numbers. For instance, if we're talking about cities on a map we would want to group their latitude and longitude together. We'd represent Lagos with `[6.455027, 3.384082]` and Beijing separately with `[39.9042, 116.4074]`. If we have an inventory of books for sale, we could represent each book with its own vector consisting of its price, number of pages, and remaining stock.\n",

    "We've seen vectors, which is like a list of numbers, and matrices, which is like a list of a list of numbers. We can generalize this concept even further, for instance, with a list of a list of a list of numbers and so on. What all of these structures are called are _tensors_ (i.e. the \"tensor\" in \"TensorFlow\"). They are distinguished by their _rank_, which, if you're thinking in the \"list of lists\" way, refers to the number of nestings. So a vector has a rank of one (just a list of numbers) and a matrix has a rank of two (a list of a list of numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of rank is by number of indices necessary to access an element in the tensor. An element in a vector is accessed by one index, e.g. `v[i]`, so it is of rank one. An element in a matrix is accessed by two indices, e.g. `M[i,j]`, so it is of rank two.\n",

What if we need a logical grouping of matrices? That's what 3rd-rank tensors are! A matrix can represent a grayscale image, but what about a color image with three color channels (red, green, blue)? With a 3rd-rank tensor, we could represent each channel as its own matrix and group them together.\n",

    "\n",
    "The minimum of $L(\\theta)$ is the point where the parameters guess $\\theta$ is least wrong (at best, $L(\\theta) = 0$, i.e. a perfect score, though this is not always good, as will be explained later); i.e. the best guess for the parameters.\n",

    "There are many techniques to solve an optimization problem - sometimes they can be solved analytically (i.e. by moving around variables and isolating the one you want to solve for), but more often than not we must solve them numerically, i.e. by guessing a lot of different values - but not randomly!\n",

For instance, velocity is a derivative which expresses how position changes with respect to time. Another interpretation, which is more relevant to machine learning, is that a derivative tells us how to change one variable to achieve a desired change in the other variable. Velocity, for instance, tells us how to change position by \"changing\" time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better understanding of _instantaneous_ change, consider a cyclist, cycling on a line. We have data about their position over time. We could calculate an average velocity over the data's entire time period, but we typically prefer to know the velocity at any given _moment_ (i.e. at any _instant_).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get more concrete first. Let's say we have data for $n$ seconds, i.e. from $t_0$ to $t_n$ seconds, and the position at any given second $i$ is $p_i$. If we wanted to get the rate of change in position over the entire time interval, we'd just do:"

Partial derivatives are just like regular derivatives except we use them for multivariable functions; it just means we only differentiate with respect to one variable at a time. So for $f(x,y,z)$, we'd have a partial derivative with respect to $x$, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ (note the slightly different notation), one with respect to $y$, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$, and one with respect to $z$, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's pretty simple! But it would be useful to group these partial derivatives together in some way. If we put these partial derivatives together in a vector, the resulting vector is the _gradient_ of $f$, notated $\\nabla f$ (the symbol is called \"nabla\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-order derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that velocity is the derivative of position because it describes how position changes over time. Acceleration similarly describes how _velocity_ changes over time, so we'd say that acceleration is the derivative of velocity. We can also say that acceleration is the _second-order_ derivative of position (that is, it is the derivative of its derivative).\n",

    "## Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand derivatives, gradient descent is really, really simple. The basic idea is that we use the derivative of the loss $L(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$ and figure out which way the loss is decreasing, then \"move\" the parameter guess in that direction."
