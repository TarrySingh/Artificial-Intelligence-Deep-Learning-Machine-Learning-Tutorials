    "# Word2Vec and t-SNE\n",
    "\n",
    "A question that might come up when working with text is: how do you turn text into numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, common techniques included methods like one-hot vectors, in which we'd have a different number associated with each word, and then turn \"on\" the value at that index in a vector (making it 1) and setting all the rest to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we have the sentence: \"I like dogs\", we'd have a 3-dimensional one-hot vector (3-dimensional because there are three words), so the word \"I\" might be `[1,0,0]`, the word \"like\" might be `[0,1,0]`, and \"dogs\" would be `[0,0,1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot vectors worked well enough for some tasks but it's not a particularly rich or meaningful representation of text. The indices of these words are arbitrary and don't describe any relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "[_Word embeddings_](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) provide a meaningful representation of text. Word embeddings, called such because they involve embedding a word in some high-dimensional space, that is, they map a word to some vector, much like one-hot vectors. The difference is that word embeddings are learned for a particular task, so they end up being meaningful representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the relationships between words are meaningful (image from the [TensorFlow documentation]((https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/word2vec/index.html)):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Word embedding relationships](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/images/linear-relationships.png){:width=\"100%\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable property that emerges is that vector arithmetic is also meaningful. Perhaps the most well-known example of this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{king} - \\text{man} + \\text{woman} = \\text{queen}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "([Chris Olah's piece on word embeddings](Deep Learning, NLP, and Representations) delves more into why this is.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the positioning of these words in this space actually tells us something about how these words are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to do things like find the most similar words by looking at the closest words. You can project the resulting embeddings down to 2D so that we can visualize them. We'll use t-SNE (\"t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding\") for this, which is a dimensionality reduction method that works well for visualizing high-dimension data. We'll see that clusters of related words form in a way that a human would probably agree with. We couldn't do this with one-hot vectors - the distances between them are totally arbitrary and their proximity is essentially random.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, these word embeddings are trained to help with a particular task, which is learned through a neural network. Two tasks developed for training embeddings is _CBOW_ (continuous bag of words) and _skip-grams_; together these methods of learning word embeddings are called \"Word2Vec\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For the CBOW task, we take the context words (the words around the target word) and give the target word. We want to predict whether or not the target word belongs to the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip-grams is basically the inverse: we take the target word (the \"pivot\"), then give the context. We want to predict whether or not the context belongs to the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are quite similar but have different properties, e.g. CBOW works better on smaller datasets, where as skip-grams works better for larger ones. In any case, the idea with word embeddings is that they can be trained to help with any task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be using the skip-gram task here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a reasonably-sized text corpus to learn from. Here we'll use State of the Union addresses retrieved from [The American Presidency Project](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php). These addresses tend to use similar patterns so we should be able to learn some decent word embeddings. Since the skip-gram task looks at context, texts that use words in a consistent way (i.e. in consistent contexts) we'll be able to learn better.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The corpus is available here](/guides/data/sotu.tar.gz). The texts were preprocessed a bit (mainly removing URL-encoded characters). The texts provided here are the processed versions (nb: this isn't the complete collection of texts but enough to work with here).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skip-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, let's get a bit more concrete about what the skip-gram task is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the sentence \"I think cats are cool\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip-gram task is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We take a word, e.g. `'cats'`, which we'll represent as $w_i$. We feed this as input into our neural network.\n",
    "- We take the word's context, e.g. `['I', 'think', 'are', 'cool']`. We'll represent this as $\\{w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}, w_{i+1}, w_{i+2}\\}$ and we also feed this into our neural network.\n",
    "- Then we just want our network to predict (i.e. classify) whether or not $\\{w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}, w_{i+1}, w_{i+2}\\}$ is the true context of $w_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular example we'd want the network to output 1 (i.e. yes, that is the true context).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set $w_i$ to 'frogs', then we'd want the network output 0. In our one sentence corpus, `['I', 'think', 'are', 'cool']` is not the true context for 'frogs'. Sorry frogs üê∏.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the model\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use `keras` to build the neural network that we'll use to learn the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
