# How to contribute to fastai

First, thanks a lot for wanting to help! Make sure you have read the [doc on code style](https://docs.fast.ai/dev/style.html) first. (Note that we don't follow PEP8, but instead follow a coding style designed specifically for numerical and interactive programming.)

## Did you find a bug?

* Nobody is perfect, especially not us. But first, please double-check the bug doesn't come from something on your side. The [forum](https://forums.fast.ai/) is a tremendous source for help, and we'd advise to use it as a first step. Be sure to include as much code as you can so that other people can easily help you.
* Then, ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_docs/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* Be sure to add the complete error messages.
