"""Basic Model class which provides the optimization wrap around inference.

A general model class wrapps the loss and optimizer operations around the
inference graph. Therefore, it should define the learning rate, global step
and optimizer. The current version supports a multiple gpu scenario by
enforcing single gpu to select one gpu for calculations and reuse variables.

Different models will only have different inference graphs and they share the
training and evaluation ops. Therefore, we define the inference function
as an abstract method that each model should define specifically for itself.
