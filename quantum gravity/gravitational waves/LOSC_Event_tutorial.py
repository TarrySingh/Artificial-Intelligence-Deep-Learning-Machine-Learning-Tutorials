# ## Intro to signal processing
# 
# This tutorial assumes that you are comfortable with <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a>.
# 
# This tutorial also assumes that you know a bit about signal processing of digital time series data (or want to learn!). This includes power spectral densities, spectrograms, digital filtering, whitening, audio manipulation. This is a vast and complex set of topics, but we will cover many of the basics in this tutorial.
# 
# If you are a beginner, here are some resources from the web:
# * http://101science.com/dsp.htm
# * https://www.coursera.org/course/dsp
# * https://georgemdallas.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/wavelets-4-dummies-signal-processing-fourier-transforms-and-heisenberg/
# * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing
# * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density
# * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram
# * http://greenteapress.com/thinkdsp/
# * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_filter
# 
# And, well, lots more on the web!

# ## Download the data on a computer with a python installation
# 
# If you are using a pre-configured setup (eg, in binder), great! You don't have to download or set up anything.
# 
# Otherwise, to begin, get the necessary files, by downloading the zip file and unpacking it into single directory:
# * <a href='https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/LOSC_Event_tutorial.zip'>LOSC_Event_tutorial.zip</a>
# 
# This zip file contains:
# 
# * this IPython notebook LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb, and LOSC_Event_tutorial.py code. 
# * python code for reading LOSC data files: <a href='https://losc.ligo.org/s/sample_code/readligo.py'>readligo.py</a>. 
# * the event data files (32s sampled at 4096 Hz, in hdf5 format, for both LIGO detectors).
# * Waveform templates (32s sampled at 4096 Hz, in hdf5 format, for both plus and cross polarizations).
# * a parameter file in json format, O1_events.json .
# 
# You will also need a python installation with a few packages (<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a>, <a href="http://www.h5py.org/">h5py</a>,  <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html">json</a> ).
# 
# * For hints on software installation, see https://losc.ligo.org/tutorial00/
# * The tutorial should work on python 2.6 and above, including python 3, as well as in recent versions of Ipython.
# * You *might* see Warning or FutureWarning messages, which tend to be associated with different versions of python, Ipython, numpy, etc. Hopefully they can be ignored!
# * the filetype "hdf5" means the data are in hdf5 format:
# https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
# * NOTE: GPS time is number of seconds since Jan 6, 1980 GMT. See http://www.oc.nps.edu/oc2902w/gps/timsys.html or https://losc.ligo.org/gps/

# ## Data Gaps
# **NOTE** that in general, LIGO strain time series data has gaps (filled with NaNs) when the detectors are not taking valid ("science quality") data. Analyzing these data requires the user to 
#  <a href='https://losc.ligo.org/segments/'>loop over "segments"</a> of valid data stretches. 
# 
# **In this tutorial, for simplicity, we assume there are no data gaps - this will not work for all times!**  See the 
# <a href='https://losc.ligo.org/segments/'>notes on segments</a> for details.
# 

# ## First look at the data from H1 and L1

# In[6]:

# both H1 and L1 will have the same time vector, so:
time = time_H1
# the time sample interval (uniformly sampled!)
dt = time[1] - time[0]

# Let's look at the data and print out some stuff:

print(('time_H1: len, min, mean, max = ',     len(time_H1), time_H1.min(), time_H1.mean(), time_H1.max() ))
print(('strain_H1: len, min, mean, max = ',     len(strain_H1), strain_H1.min(),strain_H1.mean(),strain_H1.max()))
print(( 'strain_L1: len, min, mean, max = ',     len(strain_L1), strain_L1.min(),strain_L1.mean(),strain_L1.max()))

#What's in chan_dict?  (See also https://losc.ligo.org/tutorials/)
bits = chan_dict_H1['DATA']
print("For H1, {0} out of {1} seconds contain usable DATA".format(bits.sum(), len(bits)))
bits = chan_dict_L1['DATA']
print("For L1, {0} out of {1} seconds contain usable DATA".format(bits.sum(), len(bits)))
 


# In[7]:

# plot +- deltat seconds around the event:
# index into the strain time series for this time interval:
deltat = 5
indxt = np.where((time >= tevent-deltat) & (time < tevent+deltat))
print(tevent)

if make_plots:
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot(time[indxt]-tevent,strain_H1[indxt],'r',label='H1 strain')
    plt.plot(time[indxt]-tevent,strain_L1[indxt],'g',label='L1 strain')
    plt.xlabel('time (s) since '+str(tevent))

    plt.savefig(eventname+'_strain.'+plottype)


# The data are dominated by **low frequency noise**; there is no way to see a signal here, without some signal processing.

# ## Plot the Amplitude Spectral Density (ASD)
# Plotting these data in the Fourier domain gives us an idea of the frequency content of the data. A way to visualize the frequency content of the data is to plot the amplitude spectral density, ASD.
# 
# The ASDs are the square root of the power spectral densities (PSDs), which are averages of the square of the fast fourier transforms (FFTs) of the data.
# 
# They are an estimate of the "strain-equivalent noise" of the detectors versus frequency,
# which limit the ability of the detectors to identify GW signals.
# 
# They are in units of strain/rt(Hz).
# So, if you want to know the root-mean-square (rms) strain noise in a frequency band,
# integrate (sum) the squares of the ASD over that band, then take the square-root.
# 
# There's a signal in these data! 
# For the moment, let's ignore that, and assume it's all noise.

# In[8]:

make_psds = 1
if make_psds:
    # number of sample for the fast fourier transform:

    Pxx_L1, freqs = mlab.psd(strain_L1, Fs = fs, NFFT = NFFT)

    # We will use interpolations of the ASDs computed above for whitening:
    psd_H1 = interp1d(freqs, Pxx_H1)
    psd_L1 = interp1d(freqs, Pxx_L1)

    # Here is an approximate, smoothed PSD for H1 during O1, with no lines. We'll use it later.    
    Pxx = (1.e-22*(18./(0.1+freqs))**2)**2+0.7e-23**2+((freqs/2000.)*4.e-23)**2
    psd_smooth = interp1d(freqs, Pxx)

if make_plots:

    f_min = 20.
    f_max = 2000.

    plt.savefig(eventname+'_ASDs.'+plottype)


# NOTE that we only plot the data between f_min = 20 Hz and f_max = 2000 Hz.
# 
# Below f_min, the data **are not properly calibrated**. That's OK, because the noise is so high below f_min that LIGO cannot sense gravitational wave strain from astrophysical sources in that band.
# 
# The sample rate is fs = 4096 Hz (2^12 Hz), so the data cannot capture frequency content above the Nyquist frequency = fs/2 = 2048 Hz. That's OK, because our events only have detectable frequency content in the range given by fband, defined above; the upper end will (almost) always be below the Nyquist frequency. We set f_max = 2000, a bit below Nyquist.
# 
# You can see strong spectral lines in the data; they are all of instrumental origin. Some are engineered into the detectors (mirror suspension resonances at ~500 Hz and harmonics, calibration lines, control dither lines, etc) and some (60 Hz and harmonics) are unwanted. We'll return to these, later.
# 
# You can't see the signal in this plot, since it is relatively weak and less than a second long, while this plot averages over 32 seconds of data. So this plot is entirely dominated by instrumental noise.
# 
# The smooth model is hard-coded and tuned by eye; it won't be right for arbitrary times. We will only use it below for things that don't require much accuracy.

# ## Binary Neutron Star (BNS) detection range
# 
# A standard metric that LIGO uses to evaluate the sensitivity of our detectors, based on the detector noise ASD, is the BNS range.
# 
# This is defined as the distance to which a LIGO detector can register a BNS signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8, averaged over source direction and orientation.
# 
# We take each neutron star in the BNS system to have a mass of 1.4 times the mass of the sun, and negligible spin.
# 
# We have found from experience (supported by careful calculations) that detector noise produces false signals with SNRs that fall off exponentially; only above an SNR of around 8 is it possible to identify a signal above the detector noise.
# 
# GWs from BNS mergers are like "standard sirens"; we know their amplitude at the source from theoretical calculations. The amplitude falls off like 1/r, so their amplitude at the detectors on Earth tells us how far away they are. This is great, because it is hard, in general, to know the distance to astronomical sources.
# 
# The amplitude at the source is computed in the post-Newtonian "quadrupole approximation". This is valid for the inspiral phase only, and is approximate at best; there is no simple expression for the post-inspiral (merger and ringdown) phase. So this won't work for high-mass binary black holes like GW150914, which have a lot of signal strength in the post-inspiral phase.
# 
# But, in order to use them as standard sirens, we need to know the source direction and orientation relative to the detector and its "quadrupole antenna pattern" response to such signals. It is a standard (if non-trivial) computation to average over all source directions and orientations; the average amplitude is 1./2.2648 times the maximum value. 
#

# ## BBH range is >> BNS range!
# 
# NOTE that, since mass is the source of gravity and thus also of gravitational waves, systems with higher masses (such as the binary black hole merger GW150914) are much "louder" and can be detected to much higher distances than the BNS range. We'll compute the BBH range, using a template with specific masses, below.

# ## Whitening
# 
# From the ASD above, we can see that the data are very strongly "colored" - noise fluctuations are much larger at low and high frequencies and near spectral lines, reaching a roughly flat ("white") minimum in the band around 80 to 300 Hz.
# 
# We can "whiten" the data (dividing it by the noise amplitude spectrum, in the fourier domain), suppressing the extra noise at low frequencies and at the spectral lines, to better see the weak signals in the most sensitive band.
# 
# Whitening is always one of the first steps in astrophysical data analysis (searches, parameter estimation).
# Whitening requires no prior knowledge of spectral lines, etc; only the data are needed.
# 
# To get rid of remaining high frequency noise, we will also bandpass the data.
# 
# The resulting time series is no longer in units of strain; now in units of "sigmas" away from the mean.
# 
# We will plot the whitened strain data, along with the signal template, after the matched filtering section, below.

# ## Spectrograms
# 
# Now let's plot a short time-frequency spectrogram around our event:

    # (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_leakage)

    # the right colormap is all-important! See:

# In the above spectrograms, you may see lots of excess power below ~20 Hz, as well as strong spectral lines at 500, 1000, 1500 Hz (also evident in the ASDs above). The lines at multiples of 500 Hz are the harmonics of the "violin modes" of the fibers holding up the mirrors of the Advanced LIGO interferometers.

# ## Matched filtering to find the signal
# 
# Matched filtering is the optimal way to find a known signal buried in stationary, Gaussian noise. It is the standard technique used by the gravitational wave community to find GW signals from compact binary mergers in noisy detector data.
# 
# For some loud signals, it may be possible to see the signal in the whitened data or spectrograms. On the other hand, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals or signals which are of long duration in time may not be visible, even in the whitened data.  LIGO scientists use matched filtering to find such "hidden" signals. A matched filter works by compressing the entire signal into one time bin (by convention, the "end time" of the waveform).
# 
# LIGO uses a rather elaborate software suite to match the data against a family of such signal waveforms ("templates"), to find the best match. This procedure helps to "optimally" separate signals from instrumental noise, and to infer the parameters of the source (masses, spins, sky location, orbit orientation, etc) from the best match templates. 
# 
# A blind search requires us to search over many compact binary merger templates (eg, 250,000) with different masses and spins, as well as over all times in all detectors, and then requiring triggers coincident in time and template between detectors. It's an extremely complex and computationally-intensive "search pipeline".
# 
# Here, we simplify things, using only one template (the one identified in the full search as being a good match to the data). 
# 
# Assuming that the data around this event is fairly Gaussian and stationary, we'll use this simple method to identify the signal (matching the template) in our 32 second stretch of data. The peak in the SNR vs time is a "single-detector event trigger".
#

# ### Notes on these results
# 
# * We make use of only one template, with a simple ASD estimate. The full analysis produces a Bayesian posterior result using many nearby templates. It does a more careful job estimating the ASD, and includes effects of uncertain calibration. 
# * As a result, our parameters (SNR, masses, spins, D_eff) are somewhat different from what you will see in our papers.
# * We compute an "effective distance" D_eff. Is is NOT an estimate of the actual (luminosity) distance, which depends also on the source location and orbit orientation.
# * These distances are at non-zero redshift, so cosmological effects must be taken into account (neglected here). Since we estimate the BH masses using the phase evolution of the waveform, which has been redshifted, our masses are themselves "redshifted". The true source masses must be corrected for this effect; they are smaller by a factor (1+z).

# ## Comments on sampling rate
# 
# LIGO data are acquired at 16384 Hz (2^14 Hz). Here, we have been working with data downsampled to 4096 Hz, to save on download time, disk space, and memory requirements. 
# 
# This is entirely sufficient for signals with no frequency content above f_Nyquist = fs/2 = 2048 Hz, such as signals from higher-mass binary black hole systems; the frequency at which the merger begins (at the innermost stable circular orbit) for equal-mass, spinless black holes is roughly 1557 Hz * (2.8/M_tot), where 2.8 solar masses is the total mass of a canonical binary neutron star system. 
# 
# If, however, you are interested in signals with frequency content above 2048 Hz, you need the data sampled at the full rate of 16384 Hz. 
# 
# In the tutorial for GW150914: https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html
# we demonstrate how to get the data at the full 16384 Hz sampling rate, do the downsampling, and show how it might limit you if you are interested in frequency content near 2048 Hz and above.
