    """
    This class describes the Generalized von Neumann growth model as it was
    discussed in Kemeny et al. (1956, ECTA) and Gale (1960, Chapter 9.5):

    Let:
    n ... number of goods
    m ... number of activities
    A ... input matrix is m-by-n
        a_{i,j} - amount of good j consumed by activity i
    B ... output matrix is m-by-n
        b_{i,j} - amount of good j produced by activity i

    x ... intensity vector (m-vector) with nonnegative entries
        x'B - the vector of goods produced
        x'A - the vector of goods consumed
    p ... price vector (n-vector) with nonnegative entries
        Bp - the revenue vector for every activity
        Ap - the cost of each activity

    Both A and B have nonnegative entries. Moreover, we assume that
    (1) Assumption I (every good which is consumed is also produced):
        for all j, b_{.,j} > 0, i.e. at least one entry is strictly positive
    (2) Assumption II (no free lunch):
        for all i, a_{i,.} > 0, i.e. at least one entry is strictly positive

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like or scalar(float)
        Part of the state transition equation.  It should be `n x n`
    B : array_like or scalar(float)
        Part of the state transition equation.  It should be `n x k`

    Attributes
    ----------
    A, B: see Parameters
    n, m : scalar(int)
        number of goods and activities, respectively
