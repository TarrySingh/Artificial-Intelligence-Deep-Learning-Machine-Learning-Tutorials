VERSION HISTORY
================

Versions 1.01, 1.02, 1.03 -- September 2009.

Version 1.10 -- October 29, 2009.
- MAJOR changes throughout code pack for speed-up.
- exactInferenceWithLL.m exploits block persymmetry and other tricks to 
  avoid redundant computations.
- exactInferenceWithLL.m allows option to not compute data likelihood.
- learnGPparams.m does not restart minimize.m if it uses maximum number
  of iterations.  By restricting the number of function evaluations
  in minimize.m, we get a huge speedup with no apparent loss in
  performance, as measured by data log-likelihood.  This is also known
  as a partial M-step, which still preserves the monotonicity of EM.
- cutTrials.m created, which segments trials before model fitting.
  After model fitting, gpfaEngine.m calls another E-step with full
  (non-segmented) trials.
- invToeplitz.m created for fast mex inversion of Toeplitz matrix
  using the Zohar method.
- getSeq.m is now more efficient for long trials.

Version 2.00 -- November 5, 2009.
- cosmoother_gpfa_viaOrth_fast.m created, which uses matrix
  downdates and exploits persymmetry for fast cosmoothing when R is
  diagonal.
- in em.m, compute R more efficiently if R is diagonal.
- in gpfaEngine.m, if no segments extracted from cutTrials.m, defaults
  to segLength = Inf, rather than quitting.
- grad_betgam.m exploits persymmetry for speedup.
- ffa_ext.m sped up by computing only sufficient statistics in
  E-step and not computing state posteriors for each observation.
  New version is called fastfa.m.
- makePrecomp.m created for fast mex precomputations needed for
  learning GP timescales.
- SUMMARY of speedups obtained in versions 1.10 and 2.00:
  1.5 orders of magnitude by segmenting trials before model fitting
    (with possibly small loss in accuracy, see "Are there knobs..." 
    section below)
  0.5 orders of magnitude with all other changes
    (with no loss in accuracy)
    
Version 2.01 -- November 24, 2009.
- postprocess.m now extracts neural trajectories for test data.
- getTrajNewTrial.m created, which extracts neural trajectories of
  new trials using previously fit model parameters.


===================
HOW TO GET STARTED
===================

Look at example.m.

Note: Matlab should be started in the current directory (gpfa) so
that it executes startup.m automatically.


==================================================
ARE THERE KNOBS I NEED TO TURN WHEN FITTING GPFA?
==================================================

The GPFA fitting algorithm is fully automatic, as there are no knobs
in the guts of the fitting algorithm that the user should have to
worry about.  However, there are two knobs in the preprocessing of
the data that the user should think about on per-dataset basis:

1) Segment length ('segLength')

  The time required for fitting a GPFA model scales roughly with
  T^3, where T is the number of timesteps in the longest trial.
  When different trials have the same number of timesteps, expensive
  computations can be reused.  This provides motivation for having a
  small number of unique trial lengths in the dataset, as well as
  having those unique trial lengths be small.

  To speed up GPFA model fitting (by roughly 1.5 orders of
  magnitude), we first segment the trials into many segments of the
  same length ('segLength').  The GPFA model parameters are fit
  using those segments.  We then take those fitted parameters and
  the original (non-segmented) trials to extract full-length neural
  trajectories. All of this is done automatically in the code pack,
  but one knob the user can adjust is 'segLength', which can be
  passed as an optional argument into neuralTraj:

  result = neuralTraj(runIdx, dat, 'segLength', 50);

  Note that the optional argment (in this case, 50) is the number of
  timesteps, not the number of milliseconds.  If the optional
  argument is not passed in, neuralTraj.m will use a default of 20
  timesteps, which we found to be a reasonable value for various
  datasets collected in the Shenoy lab.  Segmenting can be turned
  off by setting 'segLength' to Inf, in which case the original
  (non-segmented) trials will be used for model fitting.
    
  The choice of 'segLength' should be guided by the following two
  considerations:

  a) Capturing longer timescales

  In general, choosing a shorter 'segLength' gives faster GPFA model
  fitting.  However, 'segLength' should not be made so small that
  GPFA cannot find the longer timescales, whose adverse effect can
  be quantified by evaluating the cross-validated prediction error.
  Thus, one should typically choose as large of a 'segLength' as
  possible, as long as the run time is acceptable.  From our
  experience, the prediction error penalty due to segmenting is
  exceedingly small and the run time gains are huge.

  b) Minimizing overlap

  The segmentation is performed with overlap, where the overlap is
  randomly distributed within a trial.  There is always one segment
  that starts at the first timestep and another segment the ends at
  the last timestep.  Take, for example, a trial with 55 timesteps
  and 'segLength'=50.  There will be two segments, each 50 timesteps
  long, but 45 timesteps of overlap.  The overlap creates extra work
  for the fitting algorithm (i.e., it slows down the algorithm) and
  over-represents the central portion of trials (which may mean
  higher cross-validated prediction error). Thus, one should
  typically choose a 'segLength' that minimizes the amount of
  overlap in view of the distribution of original trial lengths.

2) Spike bin width ('binWidth')

  Since spikes are counted in non-overlapping bins, the bin width (in
  msec) is also the time between adjacent timesteps.

  There are two advantages to using a larger bin width:

  - A larger bin width means larger spike counts.  The larger the
    counts are, the better the square-root transform stabilizes the
    variance of Poisson-distributed counts (see Kihlberg et al.,
    1972).  Recall that all methods here (including two-stage
    methods and GPFA) assume stationary observation noise.  Using a
    larger bin width is particularly important when firing rates are
    low across the neural population.

  - A larger bin width also means fewer timesteps in each trial. This
    makes the code run faster.  Furthermore, a smaller 'segLength'
    (measured in number of timesteps) can be used to cover the same
    amount of absolute time.  Running time scales roughly with
    segLength^3, subject to issues of overlap discussed above.
   
  The drawback of a larger bin width is less temporal resolution.  We
  recommend using the largest bin width possible that still gives
  reasonable temporal resolution.  We typically use 'binWidth'
  values of 20, 50, or 100 msec.  The default 'binWidth' is 20
  msec.  The 'binWidth' can be passed as an optional argument into
  neuralTraj:

  result = neuralTraj(runIdx, dat, 'binWidth', 50);


====================================================
WHY DO THE EXTRACTED TRAJECTORIES NOT 'MAKE SENSE'?
====================================================

If the trajectories are jagged....

- Check for and remove any units affected by crosstalk.  

  Crosstalk between electrodes may lead different units have the
  same (or nearly the same) activity on each trial.  Because the
  neural trajectory attempts to capture correlated activity across
  the neural population, it will identify the shorted units as being
  strongly correlated and dedicate a latent dimension to those
  units.
      
- Remove low-firing rate units, e.g., all those firing less than 5
  spikes per second on average across all trials.
  
  The fitted observation noise (diagonal element of R) for a
  low-firing rate unit will be small, so the neural trajectory may
  show a deflection each time the neuron spikes.
 
If the trajectories look like a jumbled mess in 3D space...

- Try plotting one trajectory at a time, rather than all at the same
  time.

- Add experimental/behavioral time markers (e.g., colored dots at
  stimulus onset and movement onset).

- It may be misleading to look at just the top 3 dimensions (or any
  3 dimensions), if the trajectories evolve in a space of
  dimensionality larger than 3.  A trajectory that looks nice in a
  10-dimensional space may look jumbled when projected into a 3D
  space. You can first orient yourself by plotting each
  orthonormalized dimension versus time using plotEachDimVsTime.m.
  This plot usually looks more lawful than the 3D plot.  Then, you
  can choose an informative projection for the 3D plot.


=======================================================
HOW DO I EXTRACT A NEW TRAJECTORY USING PREVIOUSLY-FIT 
MODEL PARAMETERS?
=======================================================

There are two possibilities:

1) Load the previously-fit model parameters, then call
   getTrajNewTrials.m using new trials contained in 'dat':

   result = load('mat_results/runXXX/gpfa_xDimXX.mat);
   seqNew = getTrajNewTrials(result, dat);

2) Using the built-in cross-validation feature (by passing in some
   non-zero value for 'numFolds'), the 'result' will include
   structures 'seqTrain' (the trials used for fitting the model
   parameters) and 'seqTest' (trials NOT used for fitting the model
   parameters).  The trajectories for 'seqTest' can be obtained in the
   following way:

   result = load('mat_results/runXXX/gpfa_xDimXX_cvXX.mat);
   [estParams, seqTrain, seqTest] = postprocess(result);
   

=====================================
HOW CAN I MAKE THE CODE RUN FASTER?
=====================================

We have put in substantial effort to optimize the GPFA code.  It
currently runs roughly two orders of magnitude (~100X, varies by
dataset) faster than the numbers shown in Table A1 of Yu et al.,
2009.  On typical datasets being collected using 96-electrode arrays
in the Shenoy lab, we have found the time for GPFA model fitting to
be on the order of minutes. If further speed-up is desired, one can
consider the following options:

1) Adjust 'segLength' and 'binWidth', as described above

2) Use a smaller state dimensionality

   Tradeoff: Might not be able to capture all the structure in data.
   
   How to do it: Set 'xDim', an optional argument to neuralTraj.m.

   Running time scales roughly with xDim^3.

3) Use fewer EM iterations (dangerous)

   Tradeoff: EM might not have converged yet.
  
   How to do it: Set 'emMaxIters', an optional argument to neuralTraj.m.

   Running time scales linearly with 'emMaxIters'.

4) Use a two-stage method rather than GPFA

   Tradeoff:  Temporal smoothing and dimensionality reduction are performed 
              sequentially rather than simultaneously.
              
   How to do it: Set 'method', an optional argument to neuralTraj.m, as
                 'fa', 'ppca', or 'pca'.


=============================
NOTE ON THE USE OF C/MEX CODE
=============================

The function invToeplitz(), which inverts Toeplitz matrices such
as the GP RBF kernels, attains major runtime speedups by exploiting
special properties of Toeplitz matrices in a C environment better
suited to such computations (for loops).

The function makePrecomp(), which calculates posterior covariance
matrices within learnGPparams.m, attains major runtime speedups by
offloading parallelizable/pipelineable computations to a C environment
better suited to such computations (for loops).

These improvements require the C/MEX MATLAB interface, whereby C
code can be compiled and used from within MATLAB.  We have compiled
this code on a number of platforms in the hopes that this will be
seamless to the user, but some compilation may be required on the
part of the user if he/she is using an unusual architecture (such as
Solaris).

If the proper mex files are not available, this compilation should
be automatically done by the startup.m file, so please see the notes
there that call the "mex" command.

To understand more, please read "help invToeplitz" in
util/invToeplitz.
Please also read "help makePrecomp" in util/makePrecomp.
Other useful files to read include invToeplitzFast.m,
invToeplitzFastZohar.c, and makePautoSumFast.c.

If you have not used MEX previously, try
"help mex" and some of the online tutorials such as:
http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html .

Importantly, all of this code is written to default to a native MATLAB
code implementation if the mex file can not be properly executed.
Though the user may lose significant runtime performance, the code
should still work the same and produce identical answers.


================================================
WHAT DOES THE WARNING ABOUT PRIVATE NOISE MEAN?
================================================

The private noise variance (or uniqueness, in FA speak) for one or
more units may be driven to zero.

There are three possible causes:

1) Crosstalk between electrodes.  This can lead to different units
   having the same (or nearly the same) activity on each trial.
   
   Solution: Remove units affected by crosstalk from 'dat'.

2) The state dimensionality (xDim) is too large.  The extra
   dimensions in the latent space may be dedicated to explaining
   particular units perfectly, thus giving zero private noise for
   those units.

   Solution: Reduce 'xDim', an optional argument to neuralTraj.m.

3) You have encountered a Heywood case.  It's an issue with
   maximum-likelihood parameter learning, whereby more likelihood
   can be gained by setting a private noise to 0 than by finding a
   compromise.  This is a corner case of FA that has been known
   since the 1930's.  Various Bayesian FA models have been proposed,
   but here we simply set a minimum private noise variance for each
   unit as a percentage of its raw data variance.  This problem can
   also arise in GPFA, but is less common because of the GP
   smoothing.

   Two possible solutions: 
   1) Do nothing.  The private variance is automatically capped at 
      some minimum non-zero value.
   2) Remove the offending unit from 'dat'.
